# Learning-Utsav 2025

**Learning Utsav** is a 30-day learning challenge held during the festival season of **Dashain and Tihar**. The purpose of this challenge is to dedicate myself to learning or building something consistently for 30 days.

## What I Did

During these 30 days, I focused on learning **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**.  
As a 4th-semester Computer Engineering student, improving my **problem-solving skills** was my primary goal, which made DSA the perfect choice.

Most of my learning during this period was **theoretical** — exploring concepts, data structures, and algorithms through reading and research.

## Why I learned theoretically

The reason I had to learn theoretically rather than through video resources was due to **internet issues**.

I currently live in **Mahendranagar, Kanchanpur**, and my birthplace is **Sharmali, Baitadi**, a place many may not have heard of.

I used a wireless WiFi service from **Namaste**, but the connection was extremely poor. I couldn’t even watch YouTube videos because of how slow the internet was.  
Because of this, I relied entirely on **Google**, text-based articles, and documentation to learn DSA throughout the challenge.

That’s also why I posted all of my learnings in **note format on X (Twitter)** — because text-based content was the only thing I could consume and share consistently.

## Resources I Used

- **GeeksforGeeks** – Concepts and in-depth articles  
- **Programiz** – Beginner-friendly DSA explanations
- **Google Search** – For theoretical understanding and clarifications

---

## Concepts I Covered

- Time & Space Complexity  
- Arrays, Strings  
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly Linked List)  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)  
- Heaps  
- Hashing  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, basic algorithms)  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Searching Algorithms  

---

## Tools / Languages Used

- **C / C++**
- **VS Code**
- **Google Search** (main learning medium)

---

## Key Learnings

- Improved problem-solving mindset  
- Stronger understanding of algorithm efficiency  
- Learned how to study effectively with limited resources  
- Built the discipline to learn consistently for 30 days  
- Gained confidence in core DSA concepts  

---
## Personal Note

This 30-day challenge taught me that **consistency matters more than perfect resources**.  
Even with poor internet, I stayed committed to learning and growing every single day.  
Learning Utsav 2025 became a reminder that motivation fades, but discipline carries you forward.
